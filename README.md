# LLMs-comparision

## OBJECTIVE
To check if LLMs can identify data leaks in our code

## Approach
Create a sample code of logistic regression on titanic dataset. Intentionally include data leak in scaling feature i.e scale on entire dataset at once. The correct approach would be to first split the data into train-test and then scale seperately.
